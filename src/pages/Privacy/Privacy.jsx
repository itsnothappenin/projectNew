                Your personal information is only shared with TicketBox.az for
                the particular event for which you are buying tickets in
                accordance with this Privacy Policy and TicketBox.az's
                contractual relationship with the Promoter or Venue. Your

                by email when necessary in connection with transactions entered
                by you on the site. We will not use your personal information
                for communications not associated with your transactions without
                your explicit consent. We will not pass your data to third

              <p>
                Our web site hosts social plug-ins for the many social networks.
                When a web page containing a social plug-in (such as the
                ‘Like/Recommend’) is accessed, the user’s browser connects to
                the social networks servers and the content required for the
                social plug-ins is downloaded. When the user is logged into
                their social network account, the social network may be able to
                relate the visit to that page to the user’s social network
                account. If the user does not wish this information to be sent
                to the social network, he or she must log out of their social
                network before visiting our web site.

                Our site may use "cookies" to enhance user experience. User's
                web browser places cookies on their hard drive for
                record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about
                them. User may choose to set their web browser to refuse
